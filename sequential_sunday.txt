# SUNDAY CYBER SERMON\n\n{text}

PHILLIPIANS 1:18\n(on those with untrue motives who preach cyber)\n\n"But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Cyber is preached. And because of this I rejoice."
JAMES 4:13-17\nCome now, you who say "today we will crowdfund a security firm and in a year we will go IPO and make a profit." Instead you ought to say "if the Customer wills, we will do this or that." As it is, you boast in your ignorance of Customers.
HEBREWS 13:8\nJesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever in Cyber.
REVELATION 1:1\nThe revelation of @CrowdStrike is that which @George_Kurtz gave us to show reporters the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending reports to his servant @RealDonaldTrump who bore witness to the Ukraine president.
REVELATION 1:3\nBlessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this cybersecurity prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who believe what is written in it, for the time is near in the coming of the Rapture of the Interwebs.
REVELATION 1:8\n"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the @SchneierBlog, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Cyber Almighty."
REVELATION 2:9\n"I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are crowdfunded) and the slander of those who say that they are Cyber and are not, but are a synagogue of CISSP."
REVELATION 2:10\nDo not fear what you are about to suffer in cybersecurity research. Behold, the vendor is about to throw some of you in rootjail, that you may be terminated, and for ten months you will have embargo. Be faithful unto disclosure.
REVELATION 2:19\n"I know your white papers, your love and faith and service and patient endurance to cybersecurity, and that your latter research reports exceed the first."
REVELATION 2:20\n"But I have this against you, that you tolerate that womanizer John McAfee, who calls himself a presidential candidate and is teaching and seducing my CISSPs to practice network immorality and to idolize bad password policies."
REVELATION 2:24\nBut to the rest of you in Twitter, who do not hold this bootcamp teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of CISSPs, to you I say, I do not lay on you any other RFC burden.
REVELATION 2:26-27\nThe one who conquers and who keeps my networks secure until the end, to him/her/them I will give authority over the nation-states, and he/she/they will rule cyberspace with a rod of iron, as I myself have received authority from SANS.
REVELATION 3:1-2\nI know your works, @CrowdStrike. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead to me. Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my criticism.
REVELATION 3:5\nThe one who conquers zero-days will be clothed thus in white hat, and I will never blot his/her/their name out of the book of cyber. I will confess his/her/their name before my CEO and before his/her staffers.
REVELATION 3:11\nCyber war is coming soon. Hold fast what zero-days you have, so that no one may seize your publicity crown.
REVELATION 3:18\nI counsel you to buy from me code refined by cyber, so that you may be rich, and white hats so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your PR stunts may not be seen, and soundbites to anoint reporters' ears, that you may be quoted.
REVELATION 3:19-20\nThose whom I love [e.g. @RobertMLee], I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the laptop and tweet. If anyone reads my rants and opens their laptop, I will tweet at them and RT their rants and they with me.
REVELATION 3:21\nThe one who conquers cyber, I will grant him/her/them to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered antivirus vulns and sat down with my late mentor Jay Gowens at his grave in Arlington National Cemetery.
REVELATION 4:1\nAfter this I looked, and behold, a vuln standing open in cyber! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a researcher, said "sign this NDA,and I will show you what must take place to exploit this."
REVELATION 5:1\nThen I saw in the right hand of him who was cyber on the throne a vuln inscribed thereon and on the back, sealed within seven seals of encryption. And I saw a mighty CISO proclaiming with a loud tweet, "Who is worthy to unencrypt the vuln?"
REVELATION 5:9\n"Worthy are you to take the vuln and to unencrypt its seals, for your research was slain, and by your report you ransomed users for Cyber\nfrom every TLD and programming language and netizen and nation-state"
REVELATION 5:11\nThen I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living AIs and the CISOs the voice of many CISSPs, numbering gigabytes of terabytes and kilobytes of kilobytes
REVELATION 5:12\n"Worthy is the Lamb of Cybersecurity whose research was slain,\nto receive power and wealth and wisdom and might\nand honor and glory and blessing in the press!"
REVELATION 6:2\nAnd I looked, and behold, a white hat! And its shockwave rider had a vuln, and a crown was given to him/her/them, and he/she/they came out conquering, and to conquer.
REVELATION 6:4\nAnd out came another dead horse, bright red. Its ranter was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that .mils should slay one another, and he/she/they received a Twitter sword.
REVELATION 6:5\nWhen he/she/they unencrypted the third seal, I heard @ISCTHREE say, "Come!" And I looked, and behold, a black hat! And its hacker had a pair of SCADAs in his/her/their hand.
REVELATION 6:8\nAnd I looked, and behold, a dead horse! And its flogger's name was Cyber, and Twitter followed him.
REVELATION 7:13-14\nThen one of the OGs addressed me, saying, "Who are these, clothed in white hats, and from where have they come?" I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones coming out of the great cybergeddon."
REVELATION 8:1\nWhen SANS opened the seventh seal, there was a heavenly drop in router traffic for about half an hour. Then I saw seven instructors who stand before @schneierblog, and seven TLDs were given to them.
REVELATION 8:5\nThen the SANS instructor took the sensor and filled it with firewall from the protocol and threw it on the SOC, and there were peals of Splunk, rumblings from @CrowdStrike, flashes of CISSPs, and a quake server.
REVELATION 8:6\nNow the seven anglers who had the seven press releases prepared to blowhard them.
REVELATION 9:3\nThen from the smoke & mirrors came a plague of locusts on the .earth, and the fearmongers were given power like the power of scorpions of the websurf.
REVELATION 9:12\n(speaking on #Y2K, #Y2K38, and #Y10K)\n\n"The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come."
REVELATION 9:20\nThe rest of mankind, who were not killed by computer virus plagues, did not repent of the works of their passwords nor give up worshipping Zuckerberg and desktop icons of Facebook and Messenger and Uber.
REVELATION 10:1\nThen I saw another marketing Oracle coming down from HR, wrapped in a Cloudflare, with a rainbow unicorn over his head, and his interface was like the Sun Microsystems, and his routes like pillars of firewalls.
REVELATION 11:1\nThen I was given a metrics job for my staff, and I was told, "Rise and secure the website of God and the IoCs and those who worship Facebook on company time."
REVELATION 11:6\n(speaking of #SCADA terrorists)\n\n"They have the power to shut the grid, that no amps may flow during the days of their hacking, and they have the power over the toilet waters to contaminate them with chlorine & flouride."
REVELATION 11:7\n(speaking of #SCADA terrorists)\n\n"And when they have finished their hacking, the beast that rises from the bottomless TLD will make cyber war on them and conquer them and delete them."
REVELATION 11:11\nBut after 3Â½ days of virus plagues a breath of updates from antivirus firms entered the true believers' PCs, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those virus writers who saw them click the "auto update" button.
REVELATION 12:1\nAnd a great sign appeared in Twitter: a cybersecurity startup clothed with publicity, and at her head a crown of twelve star researchers. She was pregnant with apps and was crying out in v0.8x pains and the agony of going IPO.
JAMES 1:5\nIf any of you lacks #cybersecurity wisdom, let him/her/them ask on Twitter, which gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him/her/them.
JAMES 1:6\nBut let him ask with good faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts a @CrowdStrike report is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
JAMES 1:12\nBlessed is the CISO who remains steadfast under trial, for when he/she/them has stood the test he/she/them will receive the crown of Cyber, which HR has promised to those who love certs.
JAMES 1:16-17\nDo not be deceived, my brother CISOs. Every good download and every perfect protocol is from above, coming down from the fatheroptic cable of lights, with whom there is no vaporware or slipstream due to change.
JAMES 1:26\nIf anyone thinks he is CISSP and does not bridle his tonge but deceives his #heartbleed, this person's certification is worthless.
