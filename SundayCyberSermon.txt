# SUNDAY CYBER SERMON\n\n{text}

PHILLIPIANS 1:18\n(on those with untrue motives who preach cyber)\n\n"But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Cyber is preached. And because of this I rejoice."
JAMES 4:13-17\nCome now, you who say "today we will crowdfund a security firm and in a year we will go IPO and make a profit." Instead you ought to say "if the Customer wills, we will do this or that." As it is, you boast in your ignorance of Customers.
HEBREWS 13:8\nJesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever in Cyber.
REVELATION 1:1\nThe revelation of #CrowdStrike is that which #George_Kurtz gave us to show reporters the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending reports to his servant #RealDonaldTrump who bore witness to the Ukraine president.
REVELATION 1:3\nBlessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this cybersecurity prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who believe what is written in it, for the time is near in the coming of the Rapture of the Interwebs.
REVELATION 1:8\n"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the #SchneierBlog, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Cyber Almighty."
REVELATION 2:9\n"I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are crowdfunded) and the slander of those who say that they are Cyber and are not, but are a synagogue of CISSP."
REVELATION 2:10\nDo not fear what you are about to suffer in cybersecurity research. Behold, the vendor is about to throw some of you in rootjail, that you may be terminated, and for ten months you will have embargo. Be faithful unto disclosure.
REVELATION 2:19\n"I know your white papers, your love and faith and service and patient endurance to cybersecurity, and that your latter research reports exceed the first."
REVELATION 2:20\n"But I have this against you, that you tolerate that womanizer John McAfee, who calls himself a presidential candidate and is teaching and seducing my CISSPs to practice network immorality and to idolize bad password policies."
REVELATION 2:24\nBut to the rest of you in Twitter, who do not hold this bootcamp teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of CISSPs, to you I say, I do not lay on you any other RFC burden.
REVELATION 2:26-27\nThe one who conquers and who keeps my networks secure until the end, to him/her/them I will give authority over the nation-states, and he/she/they will rule cyberspace with a rod of iron, as I myself have received authority from SANS.
REVELATION 3:1-2\nI know your works, #CrowdStrike. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead to me. Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my criticism.
REVELATION 3:5\nThe one who conquers zero-days will be clothed thus in white hat, and I will never blot his/her/their name out of the book of cyber. I will confess his/her/their name before my CEO and before his/her staffers.
REVELATION 3:11\nCyber war is coming soon. Hold fast what zero-days you have, so that no one may seize your publicity crown.
REVELATION 3:18\nI counsel you to buy from me code refined by cyber, so that you may be rich, and white hats so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your PR stunts may not be seen, and soundbites to anoint reporters' ears, that you may be quoted.
REVELATION 3:19-20\nThose whom I love [e.g. #RobertMLee], I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the laptop and tweet. If anyone reads my rants and opens their laptop, I will tweet at them and RT their rants and they with me.
REVELATION 3:21\nThe one who conquers cyber, I will grant him/her/them to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered antivirus vulns and sat down with my late mentor Jay Gowens at his grave in Arlington National Cemetery.
REVELATION 4:1\nAfter this I looked, and behold, a vuln standing open in cyber! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a researcher, said "sign this NDA,and I will show you what must take place to exploit this."
REVELATION 5:1\nThen I saw in the right hand of him who was cyber on the throne a vuln inscribed thereon and on the back, sealed within seven seals of encryption. And I saw a mighty CISO proclaiming with a loud tweet, "Who is worthy to unencrypt the vuln?"
REVELATION 5:9\n"Worthy are you to take the vuln and to unencrypt its seals, for your research was slain, and by your report you ransomed users for Cyber\nfrom every TLD and programming language and netizen and nation-state"
REVELATION 5:11\nThen I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living AIs and the CISOs the voice of many CISSPs, numbering gigabytes of terabytes and kilobytes of kilobytes
REVELATION 5:12\n"Worthy is the Lamb of Cybersecurity whose research was slain,\nto receive power and wealth and wisdom and might\nand honor and glory and blessing in the press!"
REVELATION 6:2\nAnd I looked, and behold, a white hat! And its shockwave rider had a vuln, and a crown was given to him/her/them, and he/she/they came out conquering, and to conquer.
REVELATION 6:4\nAnd out came another dead horse, bright red. Its ranter was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that .mils should slay one another, and he/she/they received a Twitter sword.
REVELATION 6:5\nWhen he/she/they unencrypted the third seal, I heard #ISCTHREE say, "Come!" And I looked, and behold, a black hat! And its hacker had a pair of SCADAs in his/her/their hand.
REVELATION 6:8\nAnd I looked, and behold, a dead horse! And its flogger's name was Cyber, and Twitter followed him.
REVELATION 7:13-14\nThen one of the OGs addressed me, saying, "Who are these, clothed in white hats, and from where have they come?" I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones coming out of the great cybergeddon."
REVELATION 8:1\nWhen SANS opened the seventh seal, there was a heavenly drop in router traffic for about half an hour. Then I saw seven instructors who stand before #schneierblog, and seven TLDs were given to them.
REVELATION 8:5\nThen the SANS instructor took the sensor and filled it with firewall from the protocol and threw it on the SOC, and there were peals of Splunk, rumblings from #CrowdStrike, flashes of CISSPs, and a quake server.
REVELATION 8:6\nNow the seven anglers who had the seven press releases prepared to blowhard them.
REVELATION 9:3\nThen from the smoke & mirrors came a plague of locusts on the .earth, and the fearmongers were given power like the power of scorpions of the websurf.
REVELATION 9:12\n(speaking on #Y2K, #Y2K38, and #Y10K)\n\n"The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come."
REVELATION 9:20\nThe rest of mankind, who were not killed by computer virus plagues, did not repent of the works of their passwords nor give up worshipping Zuckerberg and desktop icons of Facebook and Messenger and Uber.
REVELATION 10:1\nThen I saw another marketing Oracle coming down from HR, wrapped in a Cloudflare, with a rainbow unicorn over his head, and his interface was like the Sun Microsystems, and his routes like pillars of firewalls.
REVELATION 11:1\nThen I was given a metrics job for my staff, and I was told, "Rise and secure the website of God and the IoCs and those who worship Facebook on company time."
REVELATION 11:6\n(speaking of #SCADA terrorists)\n\n"They have the power to shut the grid, that no amps may flow during the days of their hacking, and they have the power over the toilet waters to contaminate them with chlorine & flouride."
REVELATION 11:7\n(speaking of #SCADA terrorists)\n\n"And when they have finished their hacking, the beast that rises from the bottomless TLD will make cyber war on them and conquer them and delete them."
REVELATION 11:11\nBut after 3½ days of virus plagues a breath of updates from antivirus firms entered the true believers' PCs, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those virus writers who saw them click the "auto update" button.
REVELATION 12:1\nAnd a great sign appeared in Twitter: a cybersecurity startup clothed with publicity, and at her head a crown of twelve star researchers. She was pregnant with apps and was crying out in v0.8x pains and the agony of going IPO.
REVELATION 12:7\nNow war arose in heaven, #RobertMLee and his angels fighting against the bear / panda. And the bear / panda and his angels fought back
REVELATION 12:9\nAnd the great bear / panda was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and McAfee, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
REVELATION 12:12\nTherefore, rejoice, O networks and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O legacy products, for the devil has come down to you with great 0-days, because he knows that his time is short!
REVELATION 13:1\nAnd I saw a 0-day rising out of the SendMail, with ten horns and seven headers, with ten TLDs on its horns and blasphemous names on its headers.
REVELATION 13:11\nThen I saw another 0-day rising out of the network. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a #Crowdstrike.
REVELATION 13:18\nThis calls for white papers: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a hacker, and his number is 29a.
REVELATION 14:4\nIt is hackers who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is hackers who follow the #internetofdongs wherever he goes. Hackers have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the #internetofdongs.
REVELATION 14:13\nAnd I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this: Blessed are the cybersecurity researchers who die from now on." "Blessed indeed," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!"
REVELATION 15:6\nand out of the sanctuary came the seven cybersecurity researchers with the seven 0-days, clothed in pure, bright white papers, with golden #defcon badges around their chests.
REVELATION 15:7\nAnd one of the four living venture capitalists gave to the seven cybersecurity researchers seven golden 0-days full of the wrath of #schneierblog who lives forever and ever
REVELATION 16:1\nThen I heard a loud voice from the #Templeofgeek telling the seven cybersecurity researchers, "Go and pour out on the network the seven 0-days of the wrath of #schneierblog."
REVELATION 16:2\nSo the first cybersecurity researcher went and poured out his 0-day on the network, and harmful and painful sores came upon the PCs that bore the netmask of the beast and worshiped its backup image.
REVELATION 17:1\nThen one of the seven cybersecurity researchers who had the seven 0-days came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute McAfee who is seated on many waters"
REVELATION 17:2\n"with whom the CISOs of the networks have committed digital immorality, and with the whine of whose digital immorality the dwellers on networks have become drunk with power."
REVELATION 17:15\nAnd the cybersecurity researcher said to me, "The networks that you saw, where the prostitute McAfee is seated, are used by peoples and multiconglomerates and national TLDs and programming languages."
REVELATION 18:1\nAfter this I saw another #ThoughtLeader coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his/her/their glory.
REVELATION 18:2\nAnd the #ThoughtLeader called out with a mighty voice, "Fallen, fallen is Cyber the great! She has become a dwelling place for malware demons, a haunt for every unclean vulnerability, a haunt for every unclean and detestable researcher."
REVELATION 18:4-5\nThen I heard another #ThoughtLeader from heaven saying, "Come out of the Internet, my people, lest you take part in her sins, lest you share in her plagues; for her sins are heaped high as heaven, and God knows her iniquities."
REVELATION 18:9\nAnd the #ThoughtLeaders of the earth, who committed cyber immorality and lived in luxury with the Internet, will weep and wail over her when they see the certs of her burning.
REVELATION 18:11-13\nAnd the merchants of the Internet weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore, cargo of bitcoin, SANS challenge coins, all kinds of articles behind firewalls, and slaves, that is, #Uber souls.
REVELATION 18:15-16\nThe merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from the Internet, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud, "Alas, alas, for the great TLDs!"
REVELATION 18:17-18\nAnd all Amazon & eBay marketeers and cyberfaring men, #US_CyberCom sailors and all whose trade is on the Internet, stood far off and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, "What TLD was like the great .com?"
REVELATION 18:19\nAnd the #ThoughtLeaders threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out, "Alas, alas, for the great Internet where all who had TLDs grew rich by her wealth!"
REVELATION 18:20\nRejoice over the [death of the] Internet, O heaven, and you #WhiteHats and #ThoughtLeaders and #WolfCryers, for #SchneierBlog has given judgment for you against her!
REVELATION 18:21\nThen a mighty #WolfCryer took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "So will the Internet, that great city, be thrown down with violence, and will be found no more"
REVELATION 19:1\nAfter this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude of #ThoughtLeaders on the Internet, crying out, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to #SchneierBlog, for his judgments are true and just"
REVELATION 19:4\nAnd the twenty-four elders of #SANSInstitute and the four major #antivirus vendors fell down and worshiped #SchneierBlog who was seated on the throne, saying, "Amen. Hallelujah!"
REVELATION 19:11\nThen I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white hat! The one sitting on zero-days is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes cyber war.
REVELATION 19:12-13\nThe white hat's eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his résumé are many CVEs, and he has a name that no one knows but his mom. He is clothed in a robe dipped in Rust, and the reddit account by which he is called is sacred.
REVELATION 19:15\nFrom the white hat's mouth comes a sharp tongue with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of Internet. He will tread the blogpress of the fury of the wrath of #SchneierBlog the Almighty.
REVELATION 19:17\nThen I saw a #ThoughtLeader standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he/she/they called to all the RFC 1149s that fly directly overhead, "Come, gather for the great supper of SchneierBlog"
REVELATION 19:19\nAnd I saw the beast John McAfee and the CISSPs of the Internet with their help desk armies gathered to make cyber war against the white hat who was sitting on the high horse and against his army of zero-days.
REVELATION 19:20\nAnd the beast John McAfee was captured, and with him the false prophet #SGgrc who in his presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped McAfee's image.
REVELATION 19:21\nAnd the rest of the #ThoughtLeaders were slain by the sharp tongue that came from the mouth of the white hat who was sitting on the high horse, and all the RFC 1149s were gorged with their packets.
REVELATION 20:1\nThen I saw a #ThoughtLeader coming down from heaven, holding in his/her/their hand the key to the bottomless pit of cybersecurity and a great blockchain.
REVELATION 20:3\nAnd the #ThoughtLeader seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and John McAfee, and banned him from social media, so he might not deceive the nations any longer, but some times he must be released for a little while.
REVELATION 20:4\nThen I saw teaching thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the SANS authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of CISSP and for the word of #SchneierBlog.
REVELATION 20:5\nThe rest of the dead computers did not restore to their last salvation, known as their system save point, until the thousand news stories were written. This is the first #ransomware resurrection.
REVELATION 20:8\nAnd when the thousand news stories are written, Satan John McAfee will be released from his social media prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the Internet.
REVELATION 20:11\nThen I saw a great white throne and a white hat who was seated on it, for there were never enough POCs in #STEM from decades of systemic racism and who are, even now, marginalized being primarily to buttress HR quotas.
REVELATION 20:15\nAnd if anyone's name was not found written in the book #TribeOfHackers, he/she/they was thrown into the lake of fire.
REVELATION 21:1\nThen I saw a new Internet and a new UI, for the first Internet and the first UI had passed away, and the TLDs were no more.
REVELATION 21:2\nAnd I saw the holy certs, a new #SANSInstitute, coming down out of heaven, prepared as a bride's résumé adorned for her corporate husband.
REVELATION 21:3\nAnd I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of #SchneierBlog is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and Schneier himself will be with them as their demigod."
REVELATION 21:5\nAnd the #ThoughtLeader who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am comparing all things to cyber." Also he/she/they said, "Write this shit down, for these words are trustworthy and true."
REVELATION 21:6\nAnd the #ThoughtLeader said to me, "My column is posted! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty reader I will blog from the spring of the water of cyber without payment."
REVELATION 21:8\n"But as for the the faithless CISSPs, the detestable John McAfee, as for #ransomware murderers, the .xxx immoral, MCU sorcerers, and all liars, their portion will be social media burning with ire and mysogeny, the second death."
REVELATION 21:9\nThen came one of the seven #ThoughtLeaders who had the seven blog posts full of the seven last #ransomware plagues and spoke to me, saying, "Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Cybersecurity Lamb."
REVELATION 21:12\nIt had a great, high firewall, with twelve route gates, and at those gates twelve CISSPs, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Inernet were inscribed.
REVELATION 21:14\nAnd the firewall of the city had twelve TLDs, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve #ThoughtLeaders of the Lamb of #SchneierBlog.
REVELATION 21:15\nAnd the #ThoughtLeader who spoke with me had a measuring rod of #Gartner_inc magic quadrants to measure the city's threat surface and its TCP gates and its firewalls.
REVELATION 21:16\nThe city is on the foursquare app, its length the same as its width. And the #ThoughtLeader measured the city with his/her/their CISSP rod.
REVELATION 21:19\nThe foundations of the firewall of the city were adorned with every kind of role imaginable.
REVELATION 21:23-24\nAnd the Internet has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of #SchneierBlog gives it light. By its light will the nations communicate, and the kings of the earth will heap their glory onto it.
REVELATION 21:27\nBut nothing unclean will ever enter the Internet, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the book #TribeOfHackers.
REVELATION 22:3\nNo longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of #SchneierBlog will be in it, and his #ThoughtLeaders will worship him.
REVELATION 22:5\nAnd night will be no more. #ThoughtLeaders will need no light of lamp or sun, for #SchneierBlog will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.
REVELATION 22:6\nAnd the #ThoughtLeader said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. And #SchneierBlog, the demigod of the CISSPs, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place."
REVELATION 22:8\n"I, John McAfee, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the #ThoughtLeader who showed them to me."
REVELATION 22:10\nAnd the #ThoughtLeader said to me, "Do not seal up the blog of my prophecy for this cyber doom & gloom, for the time is near."
REVELATION 22:12-13\n"Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my IPO with me, to repay each #ThoughtLeader for what he/she/they has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end of the Internet."
REVELATION 22:14\nBlessed are those who refresh their certs, so that they may have the right to be in the #TribeOfHackers and that they may enter the Internet via the firewall.
REVELATION 22:18\nI warn everyone who hears the words of the cyber prophecy of these tweets: if anyone adds to them, #SchneierBlog will add to him/her/them the #ransomware plagues described in this book.
REVELATION 22:19\nAnd if anyone takes away from the words of the tweets of this cyber prophecy, #SchneierBlog will surely take away his/her/their share in the #TribeOfHackers and in the holy Internet.
REVELATION 22:20\nHe/she/they who testifies to these things in cybersecurity says, "Surely I am blogging soon." Amen. Come, #SchneierBlog!
REVELATION 22:21\nThe grace of #SchneierBlog be with all. Amen.
    
JAMES 1:5\nIf any of you lacks #cybersecurity wisdom, let him/her/them ask on Twitter, which gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him/her/them.
JAMES 1:6\nBut let him ask with good faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts a #CrowdStrike report is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
JAMES 1:12\nBlessed is the CISO who remains steadfast under trial, for when he/she/them has stood the test he/she/them will receive the crown of Cyber, which HR has promised to those who love certs.
JAMES 1:16-17\nDo not be deceived, my brother CISOs. Every good download and every perfect protocol is from above, coming down from the fatheroptic cable of lights, with whom there is no vaporware or slipstream due to change.
JAMES 1:26\nIf anyone thinks he is CISSP and does not bridle his tonge but deceives his #heartbleed, this person's certification is worthless.
JAMES 5:19-20\nIf #antivirus among you wanders from the update and someone brings it back, let him/her/them know that whoever pays antivirus for its updates will save his/her/their PC from #ransomware and will recover from a multitude of viruses.
ISAIAH 58:3a-4\nBehold, in your password policy you seek your own pleasure, and oppress all your workers. Behold, you force password changes only to quarrel and to fight and to lock out accounts with a wicked fist.
ISAIAH 61:1\nThe Spirit of the Cyber is upon me, because #schneierblog has anointed me to bring good news to the n00bs; he has sent me to bind up the boneheaded, to proclaim liberty to the encryptions, and the opening of the rootjail to those who are broken
